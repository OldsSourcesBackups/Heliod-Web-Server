These sources are a fork of the 'Open Web Server' (formely the open source version of the last IPlanet/Netscape Web Server) code published by
Sun Microsystems under the BSD license (see LICENSE.txt).

Sun first open sourced the code in January 2009:

    https://blogs.oracle.com/dzm/entry/open_web_server_launched

The last public update to the code by Sun happened in January 2010.
It has been over a year now and there have been no more updates.  At
this point I suspect no further updates will be forthcoming, so I am
forking the code to preserve it for posterity in case the upstream
repository disappears.

Look in the docs directory for more reading material.
